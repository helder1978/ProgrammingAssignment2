## This functions belong to the Programming assignment 2, 
## from the course R Programming of coursera
##
## The functions calculate the inverse of a Matrix (which can be a costly operation), 
## cache it and load it if requested later
##

## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix" object
## and defines the object functions to aid the cache/load functionality
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The function cacheSolve calculates and caches the inverse of the "matrix" object
## if it wasn't yet calculated or loads it from cache otherwise.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
